# Hello, I'm Bella ðŸ‘‹
[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue?logo=linkedin&style=flat-square&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bellaiam/)

I'm a Software Engineer with experience in DevOps and SRE, driven by a growth mindset. I enjoy developing applications that address real-world problems and leveraging data to gain insights and guide decision-making. I'm always eager to bring fresh ideas and technical excellence to new projects.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m learning TensorFlow and working on EduGenius, an educational platform offering personalized experiences. 
- âœ¨ I recently developed a Single Page Application (SPA) using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, React, and Thymeleaf. Check it out: SPA.

- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything! I have a wealth of random facts across various subjects and love sharing what I know.

- âš¡ Facts about me: Iâ€™m an enthusiastic hiker and a passionate baker. One of the most scariest and breathtaking hikes Iâ€™ve completed was Angelâ€™s Landing at Zion National Park, which I tackled in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I also enjoy experimenting with new recipes from different cultures, with tiramisu cake being a favorite among my family and friends.
